        1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?<br />
        setTimeout(booyah, 2000); <br />
        setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
    </p>
    The first is going to be executed in two seconds, and the second is going to be executed instantly.

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">
        2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
        <pre style="font-weight:bold;">
     var myfunc = function(a, x) { 
    return a * x; 
    }; 
    var x = myfunc(2, 3);
     var y = myfunc; 
    alert(x);
     alert(y(2,3)); 
    </pre>
    </p>
    6 and 6.

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">
        3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
        says “BOOYAH!”<br />
        setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);<br />
        setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
    </p>

    <pre>
    function booyah1(){
         alert(‘BOOYAH!’);
    }
    function booyah2(){
        setTimeout(function ()
        {
            alert(‘BOOYAH!’);
        }, 2000);
    }
    </pre>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;"> 4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive
        Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?</p>
    The unobtrusive solution is to register the necessary event handlers programmatically, rather than inline. So the
    practical application is instead of adding an event attribute explicitly in the HTML, the relevant element(s) are
    simply identified, for example by class or id. Then you can transfer the responsibility that would be used in the
    HTML to the javascript file, which is much better for maintenance and also good in the way that using this approach
    you are not going to have any problems related to loading files, when for example, your javascript file execute
    before the Document Object Model be loaded.
