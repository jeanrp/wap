    <p style="font-weight:bold;">1. Rewrite the JSP page in the first demo (forEach) to use scripting instead of the
        JSTL forEach.</p>
        <pre>
            <%

            Student[] students = (Student[])request.getAttribute("students");

            for (Student student :
                    students)
            {
                out.print("<tr><td>"+ student.getName() +"</td><td>"+ student.getAge() +"</td></tr>");
            }
            %>

        </pre>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">2. How do custom tags relate to JSTL?</p>
    JSTL is a standard library of JSP actions, and JSP allow us to create our own actions, that you call custom tags.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">3. What is the role of the URI in the TLD and the taglib directive?</p>
    The role of the URI is to define the directory of the TLD file, and the taglib directive is a directive that is
    going have two main attributes, which are URI and prefix, the URI attribute is going to refer to an specific TLD
    file, in this case it’s going to be a local URI in your project referring to the TLD created, and also it has a
    prefix attribute, which is the prefix that you have to use in the HTML to refer to the custom tag created.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">4. What is a tag handler class?</p>
    It’s a class that you have to create to manipulate the referent custom tag used in the HTML. It’s a class that is
    going to have all the attributes that you are going to use in your jsp file and you the class must extends the
    javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagSupport class, override the doTag method and it is also required to implement set
    methods.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">5. What is the role of attribute setters in a tag handler class?</p>
    In order to the container make the bind to the value of each attribute presented in the jsp file to the value of
    each attribute presented in the tag handler class, it is required to have a setter method.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">6. What is the role of the doTag() method in a tag handler class? </p>
    The doTag method will manipulate the attributes of the tag and return a html to the browser based in the attributes
    manipulated, replacing the custom tag.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">7. What does the operation getJspContext().getOut().write(“Hi Bob”) do when called in a
        doTag() method?</p>
    Will replace the custom tag in the jsp file to Hi Bob.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">8. What does the operation getJspBody().invoke(null) do when called in a doTag()
        method?</p>
    If your custom tag has a body inside the container will process the JSP content found in the body of the tag just
    like any other JSP page content.
