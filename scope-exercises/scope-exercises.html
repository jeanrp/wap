    <p style="font-weight:bold;">1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):</p>
    <pre style="font-weight:bold;">
             x = 1;
            var a = 5;
            var b = 10;
            var c = function (a, b, c) {
                var x = 10;
                document.write(x);
                document.write(a);
                var f = function (a, b, c) {
                    b = a;
                    document.write(b);
                    b = c;
                    var x = 5;
                }
                f(a, b, c);
                document.write(b);
            }
            c(8, 9, 10);
            document.write(b);
            document.write(x);
    </pre>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">2. What is the difference between a method and function? </p>
    A function is a set of commands defined outside an object. And a method is a function declared inside of an object.

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</p>
    It works as a reference to the current Object.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method? </p>
    By default the execution context for an execution is global which means that if a code is being executed as part of
    a simple function call then “this” refers to global object.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</p>
    In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this will
    become the new object when a new object is created.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method
        f( ) containing keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?</p>
    It refers to who is calling the method.
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">7. What is a free variable in JavaScript? </p>
    Free variables are simply the variables that are neither locally declared nor passed as parameter.

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a
        property that is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two
        if they are equal. </p>
    <pre>
        var person = {
                name : “Fred”,
                major: “Music”,
                calc : function (a,b) {
                        if (a < b) 
                            return a; 
                        else if (b < a) 
                            return b
                        else 
                            Math.pow(a,2) + Math.pow(b,2);
                }
     } 
    </pre>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">
        9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
        Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position. </p>
    <pre>
        function Employee(name, salary, position)
        {
           this.name = name;
           this.salary = salary;
           this.position = position;
        }
        var emp1 = new Employee(“Joao”, 5000, “Software Engineer”);
        var emp1 = new Employee(“Jean”, 4000, “Software Developer”);
        var emp1 = new Employee(“Thiago”, 6000, “System Analyst”);
  </pre>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and
        returns the product of the arguments.</p>
  <pre>
        function multiplicateAllElements()
        { 
            var i, multiplication = 0;
    
            for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++)
            { 
                multiplication *=arguments[i];
            }
            return multiplication;
        } 
        var x= multiplicateAllElements (1, 123, 500, 115, 44, 88); 
  </pre>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">11. Write an arrow functionthat returns the maximum of its three input arguments</p>
        <pre>
            var a = (x,y,z ) =>
            {
                if (x > y && x > z)
              return x
            else if (y > x && y > z)
                return y
            else if (z > x && z > y)
                return z
            else
                return -1;
            }
     </pre>
